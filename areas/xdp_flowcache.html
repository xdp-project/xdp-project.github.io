This document contains background and rationale for a proposal to create XDP
accelerated kernel based forwarding, but also by doing this standardised
hooks can be created that hardware packet forwarding accelerating can be
controlled via (the XDP/BPF forwarding path does the same as the hardware
incarnation.

<h3 id="org3746b5f">Background</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3746b5f">
<p>
Today Linux kernel is often used in the residential router space. This
device typically has several wired ports plus wireless interfaces. It's used
to connect a home to the ISP (Internet Service Provider). Lots of SoCs are
manufactured by companies such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, Marvell, Intel and
others, boxes are made by ODMs (Original Device Manufacturers) who typically
takes SDKs from the SoC vendors, create software images for the ISPs who buy
these devices and place them at residential customers as part of their
service offering.
</p>

<p>
In order to get good packet forwarding speeds on these kinds of devices,
often they have hardware packet forwarding accelerators. These accelerators
are controlled by code that is inserted into the Linux kernel by these SoC
vendors. This typically means performing lots of changes to the kernel that
are never upstreamed. This results in infrequent kernel updates, often a
kernel is modified and shipped to customers 1-2 years after its initial
release and then this process is performed once every 2-3 years due to the
invasive nature of these modifications (lots of work).
</p>

<p>
There are some SoCs that provide high-performance CPUs that do not need HW
packet accelerators, but instead use the regular Linux kernel forwarding
path. Examples of these are Marvell Armada 385 and 8040. These however are
not used to their full potential because the Linux kernel forwarding path is
a lot slower compared to userspace networking, for instance FD.IO/VPP,
Snabbswitch and other implementations based on similar approach (DPDK).
</p>

<p>
There has been work in the Linux kernel to speed up Linux forwarding speed
by indroducing a flowoffload packet path:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9ac06ba">
<p>
There has been work in Linux Foundation subsidiary PRPL Foundation to
standardise APIs into hardware, so that less work has to be done be the
individual SoC vendors to integrate their hardware into the kernel, ie less
invasive changes and thus less work per Linux kernel version supported. This
has been focused on WIFI and hasn't yet reached the area of HW packet
accelerators.
</p>

<p>
Testing on different hardware has indicated that userspace networking (DPDK)
has a ~5 times higher performance compared to Kernel based forwarding. This
means companies are focusing on their hardware performing well for this
use-case (often in the VNF (Virtual Network Function) space) and not
focusing on using the Linux kernel itself to do the forwarding. Currently a
Linux device being a host (itself terminating TCP sessions for instance) has
much higher performance than if it is a router (forwarding packets between
NICs).

<h2 id="org516ff85">High level proposal</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org516ff85">
<p>
This document proposes two high level work items that will improve both
Linux kernel forwarding performance and also create hooks for the hardware
packet accelerators.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd0aa3ff" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd0aa3ff">XDP/BPF accelerated forwarding</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd0aa3ff">
<p>
If the above mentioned nf_flowtable fastpath bypass could be BPF/XDP
accelerated, then performance would most likely be improved significantly on
platforms without hardware packet forwarding accelerators. By exposing the
necessary data (flow table, ARP/ND entries etc) to BPF, then lookups could
be performed by BPF and forwarding could be done using XDP/BPF and would
never have to touch regular Linux kernel for already established flows.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb681651" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb681651">API for use by HW packet forwarding accelerators</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb681651">
<p>
The XDP/BPF based of forwarding would have to expose the same information to
BPF that a HW packet forwarding accelerator would need to do its job. By
doing this work and creating standardised way of exposing needed information
the HW vendors could all use these APIs, negating all the work currently
being done to hook their accelerators into the Linux kernel forwarding path.
