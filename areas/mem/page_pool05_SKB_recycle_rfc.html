<h2 id="org390896d">New RFC patchset(ongoing work)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org390896d">
<p>
This patchset corresponds to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Git tree: <a href="https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-next">https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-next</a></li>
<li>Branch: <a href="https://github.com/apalos/bpf-next/commits/rfc_06_recycle">rfc_06_recycle</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The main difference between this patchset and the original RFC is that the
place were we store xdp_mem_info has changed. Instead of using 4 bytes on
the skb, we store the information on page-&gt;private. This allowed us to
recycle skb-&gt;data and skb fragments that followed in shinfo. 
</p>

<p>
Note here that on the original version we only tried to match that
page-&gt;private had mem_info.type == MEM_TYPE_PAGE_POOL in order to
recycle so storing the info on the page was needed.
This was not safe since other netstack functions use page-&gt;private
(i.e skb_copy_ubufs()). In order to avoid this we introduced a new bit in
the skb, called pp_recycle. Since we now pass the skb-&gt;pp_recycle bit into 
__skb_frag_unref() to trigger recycling, we could add xdp_mem_info back into
the skb instead of the page-&gt;private.
</p>

<p>
Both free related functions in skb_free_head() and __skb_frag_unref() are
intercepted and if the skb is marked for recycle, we are trying to return
the page into the pool, without unmapping the associated DMA addresses.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b172dd">
<p>
On skb cloning we replicate the pp_recycle bit on the clone, since we have no
idea if the original skb or it's clone will be freed first.
</p>

<p>
In order for this to work all skb fragments must be allocated via page_pool
and the driver must use build_skb to construct the skb it passes on the
network stack. Any driver that decides to set the pp_recycle bit must make
sure the skb holds a page_pool allocated skb-&gt;data

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf138b24">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The pp_recycle bit on the skb gets set when marking fragments for
recycling. (skb_mark_for_recycle should NEVER be used on skb-&gt;head that are
not allocate via page_pool).
Since pp_recycle lives in the initial skb, we'll try to recycle it. The
xdp_mem_info of the slab allocated skb won't match (again as long as the
driver writer has not wrongly used skb_mark_for_recycle). The skb will be freed
normally and the fragments (which will will match both the pp_recycle bit
and the xdp_mem_info) will be properly recycled. A WARN_ON will be displayed
for the slab allocated skb.</li>
<li>In order to prevent coalescing of skb's that hold slab allocated data +
page_pool data an if statement has been added which prevents that from
happening. Both skb (from, to) should have their pp_recycle bit value
equal to allow coalescing. 
If we don't do that we'll try to recycle memory that does not belong to
page_pool and we'll crash.</li>

<p>
Right now we are using an skb bit for that. This is nice because the overhead
on the free path is going to be minimal, since the bit we need to access for
our recycling decisions is probably already in cache. 
Using a single bit in the skb has an implication though. We rely on that bit
to recycle skb and fragments and have to check validity of that bit in
skb_try_coalesce() (and maybe other places we missed)
</p>

<p>
We could use a page flag to trigger the recycling (PG_owner_priv_1 in
page-flags.h looks like a good candidate). This will in general be 'safer'
since each page will have it's own recycle 'trigger' and we won't have to
check all the corner cases were netstack packs skb-&gt;data (i.e coalescing)
This would slow down the free path though since it's an extra cache line
access per packet to retrieve the information.
</p>

<p>
In any case we should use PG_owner_priv_1 to mark the page and track down
packets that were freed prior to unmapping their DMA (DMA leaks) regardless
of what we use as our recycle 'trigger'.
