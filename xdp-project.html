This file contains the high-level XDP tasks. The items in this file are
divided into three categories, reflecting the urgency and time frame we
envision them being completed; although this is somewhat of a soft
categorisation, as the development is also dependent on the priorities of
the people and organisations involved. These categories are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Current high-priority tasks</li>
<li>Important medium-term tasks</li>
<li>Longer-term preliminary plans</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tasks are filed under the headings corresponding to these categories below,
and each category contains a description of what it (is supposed to)
include.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd710b34" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd710b34">Current high-priority tasks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd710b34">
<p>
These are tasks that are blockers for getting the XDP system ready for
general consumption, i.e., to a state that might reasonably be considered
"feature complete". This means that tasks in this category include essential
pieces of missing functionality, or significant user interface issues that
need to be resolved for wider adoption.
</p>

<p>
Tasks in this category should have a fleshed-out problem description, and
preferably a plan and someone working on them.

<h3 id="org71938cf"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Consistency for statistics with XDP</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org71938cf">
<p>
The short of it is that we need consistency in the counters across NIC
drivers and virtual devices. Right now stats are specific to a driver with
no clear accounting for the packets and bytes handled in XDP.
</p>

<p>
Progress: @dsahern (David Ahern) have started an email thread on the
subject: <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg535239.html">consistency for statistics with XDP mode</a>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4008d6a">
<p>
Some drivers are not updating the "ifconfig" stats counters,
when in XDP mode.  This makes receive or send via XDP invisible to
sysadm/management tools.  This for-sure is going to cause confusion.

<p>
Closer look at other drivers.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd4a7c31">
<p>
Accounting per XDP-action is also inconsistent across drivers. Some driver
account nothing, while others have elaborate counters exposed as ethtool
stats.
</p>

<p>
The common pattern is that XDP programs do their own accounting of action as
they see fit, and export this as BPF maps to their associated userspace
application, which a very per application specific approach.
</p>

<p>
David Ahern (@dsahern) argues that sysadm's need something more generic and
consistent, as they need a way to diagnose the system, regardless of the XDP
program that some developer asked to get installed. This argument that a 3rd
person should be able to diagnose a running XDP program was generally
accepted upstream.
</p>

<p>
There were a lot of performance concerns around introducing XDP-action
counters. Generally upstream voices wanted this to be opt-in, e.g. something
that the sysadm explicitly enable when needed, and not default on.

<p>
Driver resources needed to handle a ndo_xdp_xmit() is currently tied
to the driver having loaded an RX XDP program. This is strange, as
allocating these Driver TX HW resources is independent.
</p>

<p>
This can quickly lead to exhausting HW resources, like IRQs lines or
NIC TX HW queues, given it is assumed a TX queue is alloc/dedicated
for each CPU core.

To be able to tie resource allocation to the interface maps (<code>devmap</code>), we
first need to change the non-map redirect variant so it uses a map under the
hood. Since xdp_redirect_map() is also significantly faster than the non-map
variant, this change should be a win in itself.

Turns out the initial idea of using insertion into devmap as a trigger for
resource allocation doesn't work because of generic XDP. So we'll need an
ethtool interface; look into the existing channel configuration interface on
the kernel side and figure out how to express XDP resource allocation in a
good way.

Title:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Improving the XDP User eXperience: via feature detection</li>
</ul>

<p>
Abstract:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The most common asked question is: Does my NIC support XDP, and our current
answer is read the source code. We really need to come up with a better
answer.
</p>

<p>
The real issue is that users can attach an XDP bpf_prog to a drivers that
use features the driver doesn't implement, which cause silent drops. Or user
doesn't notice, that NIC loading fallback to generic-XDP, which is first
discovered when observing lower performance, or worse not all features are
supported with generic-XDP, resulting in unexpected packet drops.
</p>

<p>
BPF feature detection, recently added to bpftool, is based on probing the
BPF-core by loading BPF-programs using individual features (notice BPF load
time, not attaching it).
</p>

<p>
Even if your BPF loader doesn't use feature probing, it will notice if
loaded on a incompatible kernel. As an BPF-prog using something the kernel
BPF-core doesn't support will get rejected at load-time, before you attach
the BPF-prog.
</p>

<p>
This doesn't work for XDP, as features vary on a per driver basis. Currently
an XDP BPF-prog isn't aware of that driver it will get used on, until driver
attach-time. Unfortunately, due to BPF tail-calls, we cannot use the driver
attach-time hook to check for compatibility (given new XDP BPF-progs can be
indirectly "attached" via tail-call map inserts).
</p>

<p>
In this talk, we will investigate the possibilities of doing XDP feature
check at BPF load-time, by assigning an ifindex to the BPF-prog. The ground
work have already been laid by XDP hardware offload, which already need
ifindex at BPF load-time (to perform BPF byte-code translation into NIC
compatible code).
</p>

<p>
The open question are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can the verifier detect/deduce XDP feature in use, for us?</li>
<li>How does drivers express/expose XDP features?</li>
<li>Are features more than XDP return codes, like meta-data support?</li>
<li>How does this interact with generic-XDP?</li>
<li>How to expose this to userspace? (to answer does NIC support XDP)</li>
<li>How to handle tail-call map inserts?</li>
</ul>

The upstream solution for this is known as "dynamic re-linking", which

<h3 id="orgc8a3631"><span class="todo TODO">TODO</span> Busy-poll support for AF_XDP</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc8a3631">
<p>
Adding BUSY_POLL support to AF_XDP sockets was presented at the Linux
Plumbers Conference 2018 in Vancouver, BC. With this feature, the NAPI
context of the driver is executed from the process context by the
application calling the poll() syscall, instead of being driven by the
softirq mechanism. This has a number of benefits, for example,
being able to efficiently use a single core for application, driver
and other kernel infra that the application might need. With softirq,
we would need two cores to maintain any performance. Another benefit
is that the cachelines containing the descriptors do not have to
bounce between two caches, since this is now a core local operation as
the driver and the application is on the same core. The drawback is
that we now have to use a syscall (poll) in the data path and this
will slow things down.
</p>

<p>
There is already a busy_poll mechanisms in the kernel:
/proc/sys/net/core/busy_poll. When writing a non zero value in this
file, the busy poll support will be enabled for ALL sockets in the
system. There are a number of issues with this existing code when
applied to AF_XDP sockets.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The batch size is hardcoded to 8, a value that is too small for the</li>
</ul>
<p>
fast processing of XDP.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The semantics of poll() in busy_poll mode is that if you provide more</li>
</ul>
<p>
than one file descriptor, it will drive the napi context of the first
one supplied and if it has a packet, then it will NOT drive any of the
other. In other words, it will quit once it has found an fd with a
packet. This will not work for us, since we need all fd's napis to be
called since it is very likely that a packet will be found in each of
them. One could argue that this can be solved in user-space by
manipulating the array of fds supplied to poll() before every singel
call, but this would really complicate multi socket handling in
user-space.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The option is global across all sockets. Enough said.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My suggestion for addressing these issues is to introduce a new
busy_poll option that is only for AF_XDP called
XDP_BUSY_POLL_BATCH_SIZE (or something like it). This is a setsockopt
that can be supplied to individual AF_XDP sockets and the batch size
can thus also be set individually by suppling a value &gt; 0. The
semantics of this mode is that both Rx and Tx have to be driven by
calling poll(). There is no guarantee that your packets will arrive or
be sent unless you call poll() (a sendto() will still work for the Tx
case, though, but it is not necessary). In this first patch set, we
can still get interrupts and processing from NAPI in this mode, but we
have some ideas on how to disable this so that NAPI is only driven
from poll(). But that is for a later patch set. Note that the sematics
would not change when we introduce this as we already today say that
you must call poll(), since there is no guarantee otherwise that you
will receive or send packets.
</p>

<p>
When suppling multiple busy_poll AF_XDP sockets to poll() all of them
will get theire napi contexts executed, so it is guaranteed that all of
them will be driven. It is also possible to mix regular sockets,
global busy_poll sockets and the new AF_XDP sockets in the same poll()
call. The semantics for each type will be maintained, as expected.
</p>

<p>
From an implementation point of view, I believe this can be
implemented with minimal changes to the net and fs code. We can get
this new behavior by using the standar fd (non-busy poll path) and
then drive the napi from the xsk specific poll callback. We do need to
change one internal interface in order to be able to have a variable
batch size. And Jesper's xdp_rxq_info struct need to be enlarged with a
napi_id field that the drivers need to populate. This can then be used
by the xsk poll code to drive the correct NAPI.

If we simply make the redirect_map() helper check that something exists in
that position in the map, we at least catch the case where a map entry is
empty (where we <b>know</b> it is going to fail). If we then later add the
capability for a map to ensure that TX resources are available on insert, we
will get this check for free.
</p>

<p>
What is the right return code for the helper on failure? We already return
XDP_ABORTED on invalid flags, so we could create a new
REDIRECT_PASS_ON_INVALID that make non-existent map entries return XDP_PASS.
This makes it easy to implement "defer to stack on error" type programs,
<b>and</b> it makes it possible to disambiguate between "flag not understood" and
"flag understood and map is empty".

multi-buffer covers the uses cases: jumbo-frames, TSO/LRO, packet header
split.

This paper: <a href="https://www.net.in.tum.de/fileadmin/bibtex/publications/papers/ITC30-Packet-Filtering-eBPF-XDP.pdf">Performance Implications of Packet Filtering with Linux eBPF</a>
conclude that turning on the jit <b>increases</b> the number of outliers (though
not quite clear if this is actually supported by their data). This should be
investigated.

Maybe write a tuning doc as well?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3ac3810">
<p>
From <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/contributions/92/attachments/91/103/lpc18-xdp-future.pdf">the LPC 2018 paper</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A limitation of the current design of XDP is that programs get no feedback
if a redirect to another device fails. Instead, the packet is just silently
dropped, and the only way to see why is by attaching to the right
tracepoint. This is especially problematic when forwarding packets from a
fast device to a slower one. And the way <code>XDP_REDIRECT</code> is implemented,
there is no way for the XDP program to gain insight into the state of the
device being forwarded <i>to</i>.
</p>

<p>
We believe that a possible fix for this is to add another eBPF hook at
packet egress from a device, i.e., at the latest possible time before a
packet is put into the device TX ring. At this point, it is possible for the
driver to supply information about the current state of the TX ring buffer
(such as free space), which the eBPF program can react appropriately to, for
example by signaling ingress XDP programs to send traffic another way if the
TX ring is full, or by implementing AQM-like reactions when TX ring pressure
increases.
</p>

<p>
A crazy idea is to allow this egress eBPF hook to perform a new XDP action if it
sees the TX ring is full, such as redirecting the frame out another interface.
Allowing the full XDP feature set of modifying and truncating packet length
would also make is possible to implement a signaling protocol like that
described in <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3098822.3098825">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3098822.3098825</a>.
